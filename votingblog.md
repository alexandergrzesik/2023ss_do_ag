## What is a Voting System?

- A voting system is a way of electing candidates or deciding on issues by casting and counting votes.
- There are many different types of voting systems, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
- In this presentation, we'll explore some of the most common voting systems and how they work.

---

## First-Past-The-Post (FPTP)

- FPTP is the most commonly used voting system in the world, including in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
- Voters cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.
- FPTP can be simple and easy to understand, but it can also lead to "wasted" votes and disproportionate representation.

## Alternative Vote (AV)

- AV is a ranked voting system where voters rank candidates in order of preference.
- If no candidate receives a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the remaining candidates according to their second preferences.
- This process continues until one candidate has a majority of votes.
- AV can be more representative than FPTP, but it can also be more complex and time-consuming.

## Single Transferable Vote (STV)

- STV is a proportional voting system where voters rank candidates in order of preference, similar to AV.
- However, STV is designed to ensure that each vote counts towards electing a candidate.
- Instead of eliminating candidates and redistributing their votes, STV uses a formula to transfer excess votes from winning candidates to other candidates, based on the voters' preferences.
- STV can be highly representative and promote voter satisfaction, but it can also be complex and require significant resources to implement.
