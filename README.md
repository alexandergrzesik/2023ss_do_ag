This is the repository of Alexander Grzesik

I am going to use **Markdown** in this class

The class is at [CBS] (https://cbs.de)

We are going to learn:

*How digital organizations work.
*What modern types of organizations exist.
\*Present in the browser

We are also pretending we are developers, because:

1. we use the CLI.
1. we learn about the GitHub workflow
1. we will make a presentation in the browser
1. we are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed ourselves.
